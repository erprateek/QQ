## Question 1: 
Given a list of DNA sequences (a string of characters containing only 'A', 'T', 'C', and 'G'), write a function that finds the sequence(s) with the highest GC content. The GC content of a DNA sequence is the percentage of bases that are either 'G' or 'C' in the sequence.

Example:
```
Input: ["ATGC", "CGTA", "ACGT", "TTAA"]
Output: ["ATGC", "CGTA", "ACGT"]
```
