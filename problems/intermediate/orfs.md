## Question 2:
Design a function that identifies potential open reading frames (ORFs) within a given DNA sequence. An ORF is a sequence of DNA that has the potential to be translated into a protein. It starts with a start codon (ATG) and ends with a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). The function should take a DNA sequence as input and return a list of all identified ORFs.

Example:
```
Input: "TCAATGCGCATGATGCCCTAAATGGCTAG"
Output: ["ATGATGCCCTAAATGGCTAG"] -> [" ", " "]
```
