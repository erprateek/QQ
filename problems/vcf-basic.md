## Question

Write a script that can take in a file as input and output the following:
- Whether or not it is a valid non-zero sized file
- Whether or not it is a valid VCF file
- Separate header and content of the VCF file into 2 separate variables
- Print the reference assembly that the VCF was used to generate it
- Extract how many types of each variant - SNV Indels are present on each chromosome
- Output that content on the screen


Note:
VCF file contains information about 1 sample only
Familiarize and get used to argparse - we will extend this problem as well in a subsequent version
